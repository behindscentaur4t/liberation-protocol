## Validation Methodology

### Historical Validation Process

1. **Retroactive Assessment**: Applied framework using only information available 12-24 months before each crisis
2. **Blind Testing**: Assessors unaware of outcomes during scoring
3. **Control Group**: Included stable institutions to test for false positives
4. **Cross-Validation**: Multiple assessors per institution
5. **Timeline Tracking**: Measured prediction timing accuracy

### Contemporary Prediction Process

1. **Public Registration**: All predictions documented January 2025
2. **Evidence Based**: Each score supported by public information
3. **Transparent Scoring**: Full rubric application documented
4. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Monthly updates on institutional changes
5. **Future Validation**: Will measure accuracy as events unfold
